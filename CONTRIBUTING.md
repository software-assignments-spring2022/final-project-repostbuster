# Guide to Contributing

## Team Norms

the [Team Norms](https://github.com/nyu-software-engineering/scrum-framework/blob/main/team-norms.md)

## Git Workflow

Individual team members should clone the repository to their machine. Any changes made should be on a separate branch. The main branch should then be fetched to update any changes before someone requests to merge their own branch.

## Rules for Contributing

Any new contributions should be branched initially, then requested to merge with main. This will then be approved by one of the team members.

Individual contributions should focus on issues listed on the repository, or tasks listed on the current sprint board.
