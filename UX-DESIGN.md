> When Performing a reverse image search, the user can either upload an image by clicking the "Upload an Image" button or enter the web URL of the image they would like to perform the reverse image search on.</br>

### Uploading an Image
> This tab pops up when the user selects the "Upload an Image" button. Here the user can select an image on their device to perform a reverse image search on.

> Once the user is ready to perform the reverse image search, they can click the "SEARCH" button at the bottom of the page.

>If users want to go back to the previous tab, they can select the "Back" button.

### Search Results
> Once RepostBuster finishes performing its reverse image search, the web-app will return this results page to the  user. 

> This page will return a naviatable list of all the relevant matches the web-app finds based on the originally uploaded image.

> The user will also have the option to download the entire list of results (csv, txt, etc.) or perform another reverse image search. 

### Menu Navigation
> This is the menu navigation drop down that appears when the user selects the menu hamburger on the header. This is the same across the entire site.
