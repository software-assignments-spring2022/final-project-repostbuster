# Project Repository

## RepostBuster

An easy to use web-app tool that parses the internet for reposted instances of user input images and returns the relevant results to the user.

## Vision Statement

The current vision for the project is to create a web app that allows users to perform a reverse image search of an image of their choosing, and recieve a returned list of any relevant instances of the image that have been reuploaded onto the internet.

### What is a "reverse image search?"

A **Reverse Image Search** is a search engine technology that takes an image file as an input and returns results related to the image.

That means that instead of using a word, term, phrase, or sentence when performing an online search, you can use a picture instead!

### Examples of Reverse Image Search Engines

## Project history

The concept was originally inspired by a problem prevalent in online art communities: **art theft**.

There are countless instances of people reuploading images without sourcing the author, unrightfully using images for commercial use, or pladgiarism of other peoples work.

There are barely any tools available to combat this issue. The ones that are currently available are cumbersome and tedious to use. Because of this, we are creating **an easy to use web-app tool that parses the internet for reposted instances of user input images, and returns the relevant results to the user.**

The concept was originally proposed by Camilo Villavicencio, and is currently being developed and refined with Riley Valls, Hyunjun Choi, and Shery Mittal.
